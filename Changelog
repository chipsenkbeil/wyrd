Wyrd ChangeLog
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2005-09-15     Released 1.1.0.

               Implemented the 'next_reminder' command, which jumps forward
               to the next reminder in chronological order.

               Made 'search_next' more robust--certain edge cases are now
               handled better.

2005-09-13     Improved the alignment of timestamps in the reminder description
               window.

               Fixed a typo in the short string representation for Tuesday.

               Implemented the 'view_week' and 'view_month' commands, which
               view Remind's formatted weekly or monthly calendars for the
               selected date.

               Implemented the 'edit_any' command and associated
               'edit_any_template', which can be used to edit a reminder file
               without selecting any particular reminder.
               
               The untimed reminders window now accepts focus even when
               there are no untimed reminders.

               Executing the 'edit' command on a blank timeslot now creates a
               new timed reminder.  Hitting 'edit' on a blank untimed reminders
               list creates a new untimed reminder.
               
               Added support for 'nodisplay' and 'noweight' TAG parameters,
               which can be used to suppress display of reminders or give
               them no weight when determining the "busy level" colorations
               on the month calendar.

               Removed nonsensical DURATION specifiers from default weekly and 
               monthly untimed reminder templates.
               
               Added the 'center_cursor' option, which can be used to fix the 
               cursor in the center of the timed reminders window while 
               scrolling.

2005-09-12     Fixed an assertion failure caused by entering an unprintable
               character in a search string.

2005-06-23     Released 1.0.0.

2005-06-22     Added a screen refresh function.

2005-06-21     Implemented overlapping timed reminders and associated routines 
               for handling multiple reminders in a single timeslot.
               Colorable object 'timed_reminder' has been deprecated in
               favor of 'timed_reminder1' through 'timed_reminder4', so
               that overlapping reminders can be given different colors.

2005-06-20     Corrected the disappearing cursor bug associated with jumping
               between days with differing numbers of untimed reminders.

2005-05-04     Released 0.3.0.

               Converted the documentation to LaTeX format, with PDF, HTML,
               and manpage targets.

               Added "new_*_dialog" commands for creating new reminders.  These
               commands will generate a selection dialog for choosing which
               reminder file to add the new reminder to.

2005-05-03     Added a bunch of generic user-defined reminder templates.
               By default, some of these are configured to generate weekly and
               monthly reminders.

               Added a beep and error message when pressing an unbound key.

               Start and end times in the description window had been rendered
               according to the value of schedule_12_hour; now they are
               rendered according to the value of new variable
               description_12_hour .

2005-04-29     Fixed a rare bug that could cause timed reminders to become
               temporarily invisible at month boundaries.

               Optimized rendering of timed reminders window when scrolling
               (should be a little smoother now on slow hardware).

2005-04-26     Released 0.2.0.

2005-04-25     Made colors configurable via the rcfile.

               Made time representation (12/24 hour) configurable via the
               rcfile.

               Implemented external viewing of triggered reminders
               ("rem -q -g") via less(1).

               Added a resize handler.

2005-04-23     Added a configuration variable to switch the first day of the
               week between Sunday and Monday.

               Wyrd now accepts an optional reminders file as a command-line
               parameter.

2005-04-16     Released 0.1.3.

               A more suitable error message is generated when trying to run
               Wyrd on terminals without color support.

               Wyrd now discards exceptions due to errors on curs_set(), which
               is not supported in all terminals.

               Made installation script portable to BSD install(1).

2005-04-15     Released 0.1.2.

               Upon further investigation, cpp appears to be completely broken 
               on OS X.  Wyrd now ships with pre-preprocessed ML files.

               Released 0.1.1.

               Changed invocations of 'cpp' to 'cpp -P' to correct compilation
               errors on OS X, maybe others.

               Released 0.1.0.
