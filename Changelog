Wyrd ChangeLog
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2010-10-23     Released 1.4.5.

2010-10-20     Switched from personal fork of OCaml curses bindings to the
               community-maintained library from
               http://www.nongnu.org/ocaml-tmk/ .

2010-10-18     Fixed bug which prevented "quick add" feature from accepting
               UTF-8 encoded text.

2008-02-24     Implemented improved support for Remind's new "reminder
               directory" capability.

2008-02-21     Released 1.4.4.

               Fixed an instance of insecure tempfile creation.  This 
               addresses a security vulnerability that had the potential to
               cause data loss.

2007-08-17     Released 1.4.3.

               Modified the configure script to support weird locations of
               ncurses term.h .

               Deprecated the 'calendar_selection' colorable object.  For
               consistency with the rest of the Wyrd interface, the selected
               calendar day is now rendered in reverse video.

               Added the 'untimed_bold' configuration variable for selecting
               between normal and boldface rendering of untimed reminders.

               Added support for remind's 'filedir()' function within INCLUDE
               directives, for those who like to 
               "INCLUDE [filedir()]/some-extra-reminders".  Thanks to Stefan
               Wehr for the patch.
               
               Implemented more extensive shell-expansion of filenames specified
               within wyrdrc, enabling the use of idioms like
               'set reminders_file="$DOT_REMINDERS"'.

2007-08-16     Added support for Remind 3.1.0 advance warning of reminders 
               throughout the Wyrd interface, enabled via the 'advance_warning'
               configuration variable.

2007-08-15     Support new Remind 3.1.0 date formatting.

2007-05-25     Released 1.4.2.

2007-04-28     Added the untimed_window_width rcfile option, which lets the
               user set the width of the windows on the right side of the
               display.
               
               Tweaked the resize handler so Wyrd does not completely die
               when the terminal is resized too small.
               
               Made modifications to support rendering UTF-8 reminders
               (requires ncurses built with wide char support)

2007-04-23     Added the home_sticky option, allowing the cursor position
               to automatically track the current time.

               Added command-line option to append reminders using the
               natural language parser.

2007-04-22     Eliminated dependence on Bash-style tilde expansion.

2006-07-16     Released 1.4.1.

2006-07-13     Fixed the "blank screen" bug that resulted from I/O buffering
               synchronization issues.

2006-07-05     Fixed an error with registering certain color schemes.

2006-07-03     Corrected typo in the word "July".

2006-07-02     Added the 'quick_date_US' option, allowing users to choose
               between "month first" or "day first" conventions when entering
               quick reminders with numeric dates.

2006-06-26     Released 1.4.0.

               Added the 'default' color specifier, which accesses the default
               terminal foreground and background colors.  (A 'default'
               background color also enables background transparency on
               terminal emulators which support it.)
               
               Reduced the minimum terminal height to 23 lines, so screen(1)
               users should always be able to use a status bar.

               Fixed a bug that caused events with zero duration to overlap.

               Implemented "quick reminder" command, allowing the user to
               quickly describe an event using natural language (USA English,
               at least).

2006-05-02     Changed the substitution strings used within wyrdrc, to
               prevent namespace collisions with Remind's substitution filter.
               (This breaks compatibility with old wyrdrc files.)

2006-04-24     Corrected a bug in the chronological ordering of untimed
               reminders.

2006-04-22     Added some checks to prevent scrolling outside the
               acceptable date range.

2006-04-20     Implemented optional ISO-8601 week numbering.

               Made some corrections to the coloring code.

               Code cleanup.

2006-04-13     Remind errors are now handled somewhat sanely.

2006-02-24     Released 1.3.0.

               Set the default editor to $EDITOR.

               Errors are now detected when launching an editor.

               Improved the Remind version detection within the build script.

2006-02-04     Implemented the 'goto' operation, which allows the user to
               manually enter a date and then jump immediately to that day.
               The boolean option 'goto_big_endian' selects whether dates
               are represented using YYYYMMDD or DDMMYYYY format.

2006-02-03     Implemented the 'cut', 'copy', and 'paste' operations, which
               provide a convenient interface to duplicate or reschedule
               reminders.

2006-02-01     The 'edit_any' command now spawns a selection dialog only
               when the user has multiple reminder files.

2005-11-20     Released 1.2.0.

               Added the 'busy_algorithm' and 'untimed_duration' configuration
               variables, which can be used to set the algorithm for
               determining the "busy" level for each day on the month calendar.
               There are two algorithms to choose from: count number of 
               triggered reminders per day, or count number of hours of
               reminders per day.

               The configuration script now checks for acceptable versions
               of OCaml and Remind.

2005-10-30     Corrected the build script to support parallel make once again.

               Replaced the deprecated "tail -1" syntax in the configure
               script.

2005-10-15     Fixed an off-by-one error in the resize handler, which could
               cause the Wyrd status line to appear on two different lines.

2005-10-02     Fixed a bug that could cause find_next and next_reminder to
               fail.

2005-09-30     Added the configuration variable 'remind_command', which can
               be used to specify the Remind executable.

2005-09-18     The current date and time are now highlighted within the month
               calendar and timed reminders window, according to the color
               values set for 'calendar_today' and 'timed_current'.  (The
               selected date is now highlighted in the calendar window
               according to the 'calendar_selection' setting, rather than
               the 'calendar_today' setting.)

2005-09-17     If there are multiple reminders listed in the message window,
               they are now sorted by starting timestamp.

               Wyrd now chooses tempfile names that are unique for each user.

               Added the 'help' command, which generates a list of all
               keybindings.

2005-09-21     Released 1.1.1.

2005-09-20     Updated the build script to support the NetBSD environment.

2005-09-17     Implemented a built-in calendar layout algorithm, and removed
               the dependence on cal(1).

2005-09-15     Released 1.1.0.

               Implemented the 'next_reminder' command, which jumps forward
               to the next reminder in chronological order.

               Made 'search_next' more robust--certain edge cases are now
               handled better.

2005-09-13     Improved the alignment of timestamps in the reminder description
               window.

               Fixed a typo in the short string representation for Tuesday.

               Implemented the 'view_week' and 'view_month' commands, which
               view Remind's formatted weekly or monthly calendars for the
               selected date.

               Implemented the 'edit_any' command and associated
               'edit_any_template', which can be used to edit a reminder file
               without selecting any particular reminder.
               
               The untimed reminders window now accepts focus even when
               there are no untimed reminders.

               Executing the 'edit' command on a blank timeslot now creates a
               new timed reminder.  Hitting 'edit' on a blank untimed reminders
               list creates a new untimed reminder.
               
               Added support for 'nodisplay' and 'noweight' TAG parameters,
               which can be used to suppress display of reminders or give
               them no weight when determining the "busy level" colorations
               on the month calendar.

               Removed nonsensical DURATION specifiers from default weekly and 
               monthly untimed reminder templates.
               
               Added the 'center_cursor' option, which can be used to fix the 
               cursor in the center of the timed reminders window while 
               scrolling.

2005-09-12     Fixed an assertion failure caused by entering an unprintable
               character in a search string.

2005-06-23     Released 1.0.0.

2005-06-22     Added a screen refresh function.

2005-06-21     Implemented overlapping timed reminders and associated routines 
               for handling multiple reminders in a single timeslot.
               Colorable object 'timed_reminder' has been deprecated in
               favor of 'timed_reminder1' through 'timed_reminder4', so
               that overlapping reminders can be given different colors.

2005-06-20     Corrected the disappearing cursor bug associated with jumping
               between days with differing numbers of untimed reminders.

2005-05-04     Released 0.3.0.

               Converted the documentation to LaTeX format, with PDF, HTML,
               and manpage targets.

               Added "new_*_dialog" commands for creating new reminders.  These
               commands will generate a selection dialog for choosing which
               reminder file to add the new reminder to.

2005-05-03     Added a bunch of generic user-defined reminder templates.
               By default, some of these are configured to generate weekly and
               monthly reminders.

               Added a beep and error message when pressing an unbound key.

               Start and end times in the description window had been rendered
               according to the value of schedule_12_hour; now they are
               rendered according to the value of new variable
               description_12_hour .

2005-04-29     Fixed a rare bug that could cause timed reminders to become
               temporarily invisible at month boundaries.

               Optimized rendering of timed reminders window when scrolling
               (should be a little smoother now on slow hardware).

2005-04-26     Released 0.2.0.

2005-04-25     Made colors configurable via the rcfile.

               Made time representation (12/24 hour) configurable via the
               rcfile.

               Implemented external viewing of triggered reminders
               ("rem -q -g") via less(1).

               Added a resize handler.

2005-04-23     Added a configuration variable to switch the first day of the
               week between Sunday and Monday.

               Wyrd now accepts an optional reminders file as a command-line
               parameter.

2005-04-16     Released 0.1.3.

               A more suitable error message is generated when trying to run
               Wyrd on terminals without color support.

               Wyrd now discards exceptions due to errors on curs_set(), which
               is not supported in all terminals.

               Made installation script portable to BSD install(1).

2005-04-15     Released 0.1.2.

               Upon further investigation, cpp appears to be completely broken 
               on OS X.  Wyrd now ships with pre-preprocessed ML files.

               Released 0.1.1.

               Changed invocations of 'cpp' to 'cpp -P' to correct compilation
               errors on OS X, maybe others.

               Released 0.1.0.
