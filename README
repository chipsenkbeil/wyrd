Please see the 'doc' subdirectory for installation and usage
instructions.

DEVELOPERS: Invoke "prep-devtree.sh" to grab a snapshot of the build
dependencies.

## Mac Notes

Need the following packages from Homebrew:
- `camlp4`
- `ncurses`

Then, run `autoconf` to get a configure file. From there, run like normal
via `./configure --enable-utf8`, `make`, and `make install`.
