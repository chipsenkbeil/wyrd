\section{Introduction}
Wyrd is a text-based front-end to Remind, a sophisticated calendar and alarm
program available from
%BEGIN LATEX
Roaring Penguin Software,
Inc.\footnote{http://www.roaringpenguin.com/penguin/open\_source\_remind.php}
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/penguin/open_source_remind.php">Roaring Penguin Software, Inc.</a> \end{rawhtml}
Wyrd serves two purposes:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item It displays reminders in a scrollable timetable view suitable for visualizing
      your calendar at a glance.
   \item It makes creating and editing reminders fast and easy.  However, Wyrd
      does not hide Remind's textfile programmability, for this is what makes
      Remind a truly powerful calendaring system.
\end{enumerate}
Wyrd also requires only a fraction of the resources of most calendar programs
available today.


\section{Installation}
This section describes how to install Wyrd by compiling from source.  Wyrd has been
packaged for a number of popular Linux/Unix variants, so you may be able to save yourself
some time by installing from a package provided by your OS distribution.

Wyrd is designed to be portable to most Unix-like operating systems, including
GNU/Linux, *BSD, and Mac OS X.  Before installing Wyrd, your system must have the
following software installed:
\begin{itemize}
   \item
%BEGIN LATEX
      OCaml\footnote{http://caml.inria.fr} $\ge$ 3.08
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/">OCaml</a> >= 3.08 \end{rawhtml} 
   \item 
%BEGIN LATEX

%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html">ncurses library</a> \end{rawhtml} 
      (and development headers)
   \item 
%BEGIN LATEX
      Remind \footnote{http://www.roaringpenguin.com/penguin/open\_source\_remind.php} $\ge$ 3.1.0
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/penguin/open_source_remind.php">Remind</a> >= 3.1.0 \end{rawhtml}
   \item 
%BEGIN LATEX
      GNU make\footnote{http://www.gnu.org/software/make/}
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU make</a> \end{rawhtml}
   \item the Unix pager application, \texttt{less} 
\end{itemize}
Wyrd may be compiled by executing the following at the root of the source tree:
\begin{verbatim}
./configure
make
\end{verbatim}
After compiling, become root and execute
\begin{verbatim}
make install
\end{verbatim}
to complete the installation process.  The \texttt{make} command here should correspond to GNU make; on some
systems (particularly *BSD), you may need to use \texttt{gmake}.

If your ncurses library was built with wide character support, Wyrd can be configured
to render UTF-8 encoded reminders.  To enable this option, use the command
\begin{verbatim}
./configure --enable-utf8
\end{verbatim}
when configuring the sources.

This section describes how to use Wyrd in its default configuration.  After
familiarizing yourself with the basic operations as outlined in this section,
you may wish to consult 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{advanced} 
%@% ELSE %@%
the \Cmd{wyrdrc}{5} manpage
%@% END-IF %@%
to see how Wyrd can be configured to better fit your needs.

\subsection{Overview}
Before attempting to use Wyrd, learn how to use Remind.  Wyrd makes no attempt
to hide the details of Remind programming from the user.  
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Aside from reading the Remind manpage, you may get some useful pointers by reading 
%BEGIN LATEX
Mike Harris's article on 43 Folders\footnote{http://www.43folders.com/2005/02/guest\_mike\_harr.html}
or David Skoll's writeup on Linux Journal\footnote{http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3529}.
The 43 Folders Wiki also has a nice section on Remind\footnote{http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Remind}.
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/02/guest_mike_harr.html">Mike Harris's article on 43 folders</a> \end{rawhtml}
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} or <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3529">David Skoll's writeup on Linux Journal</a>.\end{rawhtml}
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} The 43 Folders Wiki also has a <a href="http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Remind">nice section on Remind</a>.\end{rawhtml}

You can launch Wyrd using the default reminder file by executing
\texttt{wyrd}.  If desired, a different reminder file (or reminder directory)
may be selected by executing \texttt{wyrd <filename>}.
%@% ELSE %@%
%@% END-IF %@%

At the top of the window is a short (incomplete) list of keybindings.

The left window displays a scrollable timetable view, with reminders
highlighted in various colors.  If the \texttt{DURATION} specifier is used for a
reminder, the highlighted area is rendered with an appropriate size.
Overlapping reminders are rendered using one of four different indentation
levels so that all reminders are at least partially visible.  If the current
time is visible in this window, it is highlighted in red.

The upper right window displays a month calendar, with the color of each day
representing the number of reminders it contains.  The colors range across
shades of white to blue to magenta as the number of reminders increases.  The
selected date is highlighted in cyan; if the current date is visible, it
is highlighted in red.

The lower right window displays a list of the untimed reminders falling on
the selected date.

The bottom window displays the full text of the \texttt{MSG} for the reminder
or reminders that are currently selected.

\subsection{Navigation}
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}[t]{|l|l|}
%@% ELSE %@%
\begin{Table}{2}
%@% END-IF %@%
      \hline
      Action & Keypress \\
      \hline 
      scroll up and down the schedule & \texttt{<up>}, \texttt{<down>} or \texttt{k}, \texttt{j} \\
      jump back or forward by a day & \texttt{<pageup>}, \texttt{<pagedown>} or \texttt{4}, \texttt{6} or \texttt{<}, \texttt{>} or \texttt{H}, \texttt{L} \\
      jump back or forward by a week & \texttt{8}, \texttt{2} or \texttt{[}, \texttt{]} or \texttt{K}, \texttt{J} \\
      jump back or forward by a month & \texttt{\{}, \texttt{\}} \\
      jump to current date and time & \texttt{<home>} \\
      jump to the next reminder & \texttt{<tab>} \\
      switch between schedule and untimed reminders window & \texttt{<left>}, \texttt{<right>} or \texttt{h}, \texttt{l} \\
      zoom in on the schedule & \texttt{z} \\
      scroll the description window up and down & \texttt{d}, \texttt{D} \\
      \hline
%@% IF LATEX %@%
   \end{tabular}
\end{center}
%@% ELSE %@%
\end{Table}
%@% END-IF %@%

Notice that if you have a numeric keypad, the \{\texttt{4, 6, 8, 2}\} keys will
let you move directionally in the month calendar view at the upper-right of the
screen.  Similarly, \{\texttt{H, J, K, L}\} will cause directional calendar
movement using the standard mapping from 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\texttt{vi(1)}.
%@% ELSE %@%
\Cmd{vi}{1}.
%@% END-IF %@%

In addition to the hotkeys provided above, Wyrd lets you jump immediately to a
desired date by pressing \texttt{'g'}, entering in a date specifier, and
then pressing \texttt{<return>}.  Any of the following date specifiers may be used:
\begin{itemize}
   \item 8 digits representing year, month, and day: YYYYMMDD
   \item 4 digits representing month and day (of current year): MMDD
   \item 2 digits representing day (of current month and year): DD
\end{itemize}
(The date specifier format may be changed to DDMMYYYY; consult
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{variables}.
%@% ELSE %@%
the section on CONFIGURATION VARIABLES.
%@% END-IF %@%
)

\subsection{Editing Reminders}
Note: By default, Wyrd is configured to modify your reminder files using the
text editor specified by the \texttt{\$EDITOR} environment variable.  (This
configuration has been tested successfully with a number of common settings for
\texttt{\$EDITOR}, including \texttt{'vim'}, \texttt{'emacs'}, and
\texttt{'nano'}.)  If you wish to use a different editor, see
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{advanced}.
%@% ELSE %@%
the \Cmd{wyrdrc}{5} manpage.
%@% END-IF %@%

If you select a timeslot in the schedule view, then hit \texttt{'t'}, you will begin
creating a new timed reminder.  Wyrd will open up your reminder file in your
favorite editor and move the cursor to the end of the file, where a new
reminder template has been created.  The template has the selected date and
time filled in, so in many cases you will only need to fill in a \texttt{MSG} value.

Similarly, hitting \texttt{'u'} will begin creating an untimed reminder.
\texttt{'w'} will create a weekly timed reminder, and \texttt{'W'} will create a
weekly untimed reminder; \texttt{'m'} will create a monthly timed reminder, and
\texttt{'M'} will create a monthly untimed reminder.

\texttt{'T'} and \texttt{'U'} also create timed and untimed reminders
(respectively), but first will provide a selection dialog for you to choose
which reminder file you want to add this reminder to.  The set of reminder files
is determined by scanning the \texttt{INCLUDE} lines in your default reminder
file.  (If you use a reminder directory, then all \texttt{*.rem} files in that directory
will be available along with all \texttt{INCLUDE}d files.)

If you select a reminder (either timed or untimed) and hit \texttt{<return>}, you
will begin editing that reminder.  Wyrd will open up the appropriate reminders
file in your editor and move the cursor to the corresponding \texttt{REM} line.

If you select a timeslot that contains multiple overlapping reminders, Wyrd
will provide a dialog that allows you to select the desired reminder.

If you hit \texttt{<enter>} on a blank timeslot, Wyrd will begin creating a new
timed or untimed reminder (depending on whether the timed or the untimed window
is selected).

Finally, pressing \texttt{'e'} will open the reminder file in your editor without
attempting to select any particular reminder.

\subsection{Quick Reminders}
Wyrd offers an additional mode for entering simple reminders quickly.  Press
\texttt{'q'}, and you will be prompted for an event description.  Simply enter
a description for the event using natural language, then press
\texttt{<return>}.  Examples:
\begin{itemize}
   \item meeting with Bob tomorrow at 11
   \item drop off package at 3pm
   \item wednesday 10am-11:30 go grocery shopping
   \item Board game night 20:15 next Fri
   \item 7/4 independence day
   \item 7/4/2007 independence day (next year)
   \item independence day (next year) on 2007-07-04
\end{itemize}
If your event description can be understood, Wyrd will immediately create the
reminder and scroll the display to its location.

Currently the quick reminder mode tends to favor USA English conventions, as
generalizing the natural language parser would require some work.

Wyrd also allows you to use the "quick reminder" syntax to create new reminders
from the command line, using the \texttt{-a} or \texttt{--add} options.  For
example,
\begin{verbatim}
wyrd --add "dinner with neighbors tomorrow at 7pm"
\end{verbatim}
would create a new reminder for tomorrow evening.  When used in this mode,
Wyrd exits silently with error code 0 if the reminder was successfully created.
If the reminder could not be created (e.g. if the reminder syntax could not be
parsed), Wyrd prints an error message and exits with a nonzero error code.

\subsection{Cutting and Pasting Reminders}
Reminders can be easily duplicated or rescheduled through the use of Wyrd's
cutting and pasting features.

Selecting a reminder and pressing \texttt{'X'} will cut that reminder: the
corresponding \texttt{REM} line is deleted from your reminders file, and the
reminder is copied to Wyrd's clipboard.  To copy a reminder without deleting it,
use \texttt{'y'} instead.

To paste a reminder from the clipboard back into your schedule, just move the
cursor to the desired date/time and press \texttt{'p'}.  Wyrd will append a
new \texttt{REM} line to the end of your reminders file, and open the file with
your editor.  The \texttt{REM} line will be configured to trigger on the
selected date.  If the copied reminder was timed, then the pasted reminder will
be set to trigger at the selected time using the original \texttt{DURATION}
setting.  (Additional Remind settings such as \texttt{delta} and \texttt{tdelta}
are not preserved by copy-and-paste.)

If you wish to paste a reminder into a non-default reminders file, use
\texttt{'P'}.  This will spawn a selection dialog where you can choose the
file that will hold the new reminder.

WARNING: Cutting a reminder will delete only the single \texttt{REM} command
responsible for triggering it.  If you are using more complicated Remind
scripting techniques to generate a particular reminder, then the \texttt{cut}
operation may not do what you want.

\subsection{Viewing Reminders}

Aside from viewing reminders as they fall in the schedule, you can press
\texttt{'r'} to view all reminders triggered on the selected date in a
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\texttt{less(1)}
%@% ELSE %@%
\Cmd{less}{1}
%@% END-IF %@%
window.  Similarly, \texttt{'R'} will view all reminders triggered
on or after the selected date (all non-expired reminders are triggered).

If you want to get a more global view of your schedule, Wyrd will also
let you view Remind's formatted calendar output in a 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\texttt{less(1)}
%@% ELSE %@%
\Cmd{less}{1}
%@% END-IF %@%
window.  Pressing \texttt{'c'} will view a one-week calendar that contains
the selected date, while pressing \texttt{'C'} will view a one-month calendar
containing the selected date.

\subsection{Searching for Reminders}

Wyrd allows you to search for reminders with \texttt{MSG} values that match a search
string.  Press \texttt{'/'} to start entering a (case insensitive) regular
expression.  After the expression has been entered, press \texttt{<return>} and
Wyrd will locate the next reminder that matches the regexp.  Press \texttt{'n'} to
repeat the same search.  Entry of a search string may be cancelled with
\texttt{<esc>}.

The regular expression syntax is Emacs-compatible.

Note: Sorry, there is no "search backward" function.  The search function
requires the use of \texttt{"remind -n"}, which operates only forward in time.
For the same reason, there is a command to jump forward to the next reminder,
but no command to jump backward to the previous reminder.

\subsection{Other Commands}

A list of all keybindings may be viewed by pressing \texttt{'?'}.  You can exit
Wyrd by pressing \texttt{'Q'}.  If the screen is corrupted for some reason, hit
\texttt{'Ctrl-L'} to refresh the display.

\subsection{Alarm Strategies}
You may wish to generate some sort of alarm when a reminder is triggered.
Wyrd does not offer any special alarm functionality, because Remind can handle
the job already.  Check the Remind manpage and consider how the \texttt{-k}
option could be used to generate alarms with the aid of external programs.  For
example, the following command will generate a popup window using
\texttt{gxmessage(1)} whenever a timed reminder is triggered:
\begin{verbatim}
remind -z -k'gxmessage -title "reminder" %s &' ~/.reminders &
\end{verbatim}
(A sensible way to start this alarm command is to place it in
\texttt{\~{}.xinitrc} so that it launches when the X server is started.)
If you want some advance warning (say, 15 minutes), you can cause Remind to
trigger early by setting a \texttt{tdelta} in the AT clause:
\begin{verbatim}
   REM Nov 27 2005 AT 14:30 +15 MSG Do something
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively, if you want to generate alarms only for specific reminders,
consider using Remind's \texttt{RUN} command.  This process could be easily
automated by using the \texttt{template\emph{N}} configuration variables
described in
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{advanced}.
%@% ELSE %@%
the \Cmd{wyrdrc}{5} manpage.
%@% END-IF %@%

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

Remind's \texttt{TAG} specifier may be used to cause Wyrd to give special
treatment to certain reminders.  If a reminder line includes the clause
\texttt{"TAG noweight"}, then Wyrd will not give that reminder any weight when
determining the ``busy level'' colorations applied to the month calendar.  If a
reminder line includes the clause \texttt{"TAG nodisplay"}, then Wyrd will
neither display that reminder nor give it any weight when determining the month
calendar colorations.  The tag parameters are case insensitive.

WARNING: These tag parameters are not guaranteed to interact well with other
Remind front-ends such as tkremind.

Wyrd reads a run-configuration textfile (generally \texttt{/etc/wyrdrc} or

%@% END-IF %@%
to represent Control or Meta (Alt) modifiers, respectively; note that the
backslash must be doubled.  A number of special keys lack single-character
representations, so the following strings may be used to represent them:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{"<esc>"}
   \item \texttt{"<tab>"}
   \item \texttt{"<enter>"}
   \item \texttt{"<return>"}
   \item \texttt{"<insert>"}

   \item \texttt{"<down>"}
   \item \texttt{"<f1>"} to \texttt{"<f12>"}
\end{itemize}
Due to differences between various terminal emulators, this key identifier syntax may
not be adequate to describe every keypress.  As a workaround, Wyrd will also accept key
identifiers in octal notation.  As an example, you could use 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\texttt{$\backslash$024} 
%@% ELSE %@%
\Bs 024

      strings \texttt{'\%file\%'} and \texttt{'\%line\%'} will be replaced with a
      filename to edit and a line number to navigate to within that file.
   \item \texttt{edit\_new\_command} \\
      Controls the command used to edit a new reminder.  The special character
      \texttt{'\%file\%'} will be replaced with a filename to edit.  Ideally, this
      command should move the cursor to the last line of the file, where the new
      reminder template is created.
   \item \texttt{edit\_any\_command} \\
      Controls the command used for editing a reminder file without selecting
      any particular reminder.  The special character \texttt{'\%file\%'} will be
      replaced with a filename to edit.
   \item \texttt{timed\_template} \\
      Controls the format of the \texttt{REM} line created when editing a new
      timed reminder.  The following string substitutions will be made:
      \texttt{'\%monname\%'} - month name, \texttt{'\%mon\%'} - month number,
      \texttt{'\%mday\%'} - day of the month, \texttt{'\%year\%'} - year, 
      \texttt{'\%hour\%'} - hour, \texttt{'\%min\%'} - minute,
      \texttt{'\%wdayname\%'} - weekday name, \texttt{'\%wday\%'} - weekday number.
   \item \texttt{untimed\_template} \\
      Controls the format of the \texttt{REM} line created when editing a new
      untimed reminder.  The substitution syntax is the same as for
      \texttt{timed\_template}.
   %@% IF LATEX %@%
   \item \texttt{template\emph{N}} \\
   %@% ELSE %@%
   \item template\emph{N} \\
   %@% END-IF %@%
      Controls the format of a generic user-defined \texttt{REM} line template;
      \emph{N} may range from 0 to 9.  The substitution syntax is the same as
      for \texttt{timed\_template}.
   \item \texttt{busy\_algorithm} \\
      An integer value specifying which algorithm to use for measuring how
      busy the user is on a particular day.  If \texttt{busy\_algorithm="1"},
      then Wyrd will simply count the total number of reminders triggered on
      that day.  If \texttt{busy\_algorithm="2"}, then Wyrd will count the
      number of hours of reminders that fall on that day.  (Untimed reminders
      are assumed to occupy \texttt{untimed\_duration} minutes.)
   \item \texttt{untimed\_duration} \\
      An integer value that specifies the assumed duration of an untimed
      reminder, in minutes.  This is used only when computing the busy level
      with \texttt{busy\_algorithm="2"}.
   \item \texttt{busy\_level1} \\
      An integer value specifying the maximum number of reminders in a day
      (with \texttt{busy\_algorithm="1"}) or maximum hours of reminders in
      a day (with \texttt{busy\_algorithm="2"}) which will be
      colored using the color scheme for \texttt{calendar\_level1}.
   \item \texttt{busy\_level2} \\
      Same as above, using the \texttt{calendar\_level2} color scheme.
   \item \texttt{busy\_level3} \\
      Same as above, using the \texttt{calendar\_level2} color scheme rendered
      in bold.
   \item \texttt{busy\_level4} \\
      Same as above, using the \texttt{calendar\_level3} color scheme.  Any day
      with more reminders than this will be rendered using the
      \texttt{calendar\_level3} color scheme rendered in bold.
   \item \texttt{week\_starts\_monday} \\
      A boolean value (\texttt{"true"} or \texttt{"false"}) that determines the
      first day of the week.
   \item \texttt{schedule\_12\_hour} \\
      A boolean value that determines whether the timed reminders window is
      drawn using 12- or 24-hour time.
   \item \texttt{selection\_12\_hour} \\
      A boolean value that determines whether the selection information is drawn
      with 12- or 24-hour time.
   \item \texttt{status\_12\_hour} \\
      A boolean value that determines whether the current time is drawn using a
      12- or 24-hour clock.
   \item \texttt{description\_12\_hour} \\
      A boolean value that determines whether reminder start and end times are
      drawn using 12- or 24-hour time in the description window.  This value
      also controls the format of timestamps in the formatted calendars
      produced by \texttt{view\_week} and \texttt{view\_month}.
   \item \texttt{center\_cursor} \\
      A boolean value that determines how the screen and cursor move during 
      scrolling operations.  When set to \texttt{"true"}, the cursor is fixed 
      in the center of the timed reminders window, and the schedule scrolls around
      it.  When set to \texttt{"false"} (the default), the cursor will move up
      and down the schedule during scrolling operations.
   \item \texttt{goto\_big\_endian} \\
      A boolean value that determines how the the \texttt{goto} operation will
      parse dates.  When set to \texttt{"true"}, date specifiers should be in
      ISO 8601 (YYYYMMDD) format.  When set to \texttt{"false"}, date specifiers
      should be in European style DDMMYYYY format.
   \item \texttt{quick\_date\_US} \\
      A boolean value that determines how the \texttt{quick\_add} operation
      will parse numeric dates with slashes, e.g. 6/1 (or 6/1/2006).  When set
      to \texttt{"true"}, the first number is a month and the second is the day
      of the month (June 1).  When set to \texttt{"false"}, these meanings of
      these two fields are switched (January 6).
   \item \texttt{number\_weeks} \\
      A boolean value that determines whether or not weeks should be numbered
      within the month calendar window.  Weeks are numbered according to the ISO
      8601 standard.  The ISO standard week begins on Monday, so to avoid
      confusion it is recommended that \texttt{week\_starts\_monday} be set to 
      \texttt{"true"} when week numbering is enabled.
   \item \texttt{home\_sticky} \\
      A boolean value that determines whether or not the cursor should
      "stick" to the "home" position.  When this option is set to 
      \texttt{"true"}, then after pressing the \texttt{<home>} key the
      cursor will automatically follow the current date and time.  The
      effect is cancelled by pressing any of the navigation keys.
   \item \texttt{untimed\_window\_width} \\
      An integer value that determines the target width of the month-calendar
      window and the untimed reminders window.  The allowable range is
      34 to (\texttt{\$COLUMNS} - 40) characters, and Wyrd will silently
      disregard any setting outside this range.
   \item \texttt{advance\_warning} \\
      A boolean value that determines whether or not Wyrd should display
      advance warning of reminders.  When set to \texttt{"true"}, Wyrd
      will invoke Remind in a mode that generates advance warning of reminders
      as specified in the reminder file.
   \item \texttt{untimed\_bold} \\
      A boolean value that determines whether or not Wyrd should render
      untimed reminders using a bold font.
\end{itemize}
For maximum usefulness, \texttt{busy\_level1} $<$ \texttt{busy\_level2} $<$ 
\texttt{busy\_level3} $<$ \texttt{busy\_level4}.

\section{Usage Tips}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Wyrd fills in sensible defaults for the fields of a \texttt{REM} statement, but
      you will inevitably need to make some small edits to achieve the behavior
      you want. If you use Vim, you can make your life easier by installing the
      Vim-Latex Suite and then modifying your 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
      \texttt{\~{}/.wyrdrc}
%@% ELSE %@%
      \Tilde/.wyrdrc
%@% END-IF %@%
      to use \texttt{REM} templates like this:

%@% IF LATEX %@%
      \texttt{set timed\_template="REM \%monname\% \%mday\% \%year\% <++>AT \%hour\%:\%min\%<++> DURATION 1:00<++> MSG \%$\backslash$"<++>\%$\backslash$" \%b"} \\
      \texttt{set untimed\_template="REM \%monname\% \%mday\% \%year\% <++>MSG \%$\backslash$"<++>\%$\backslash$" \%b"}
%@% ELSE %@%
      \texttt{set timed\_template="REM \%monname\% \%mday\% \%year\% <++>AT \%hour\%:\%min\%<++> DURATION 1:00<++> MSG \%\Bs"<++>\%\Bs" \,\%b"} \\
      \texttt{set untimed\_template="REM \%monname\% \%mday\% \%year\% <++>MSG \%\Bs"<++>\%\Bs" \,\%b"}
%@% END-IF %@%

      With this change, hitting Ctrl-J inside Vim (in insert mode) will cause your
      cursor to jump directly to the \texttt{<++>} markers, enabling you to quickly add any
      desired Remind delta and message parameters.

%@% IF LATEX %@%
   \item The 43 Folders Wiki
%BEGIN LATEX
      has a page on Wyrd\footnote{http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Wyrd}.
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Wyrd">has a page on Wyrd</a>. \end{rawhtml}
      This is a good place to look for other usage tips.
