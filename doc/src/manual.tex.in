\section{Introduction}
Wyrd is a text-based front-end to Remind, a sophisticated calendar and alarm
program available from
%BEGIN LATEX
Roaring Penguin Software,
Inc.\footnote{http://www.roaringpenguin.com/penguin/open\_source\_remind.php}
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/penguin/open_source_remind.php">Roaring Penguin Software, Inc.</a> \end{rawhtml}
Wyrd serves two purposes:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item It displays reminders in a day-calendar view suitable for visualizing
      your calendar at a glance.
   \item It makes creating and editing reminders fast and easy.  However, Wyrd
      does not hide Remind's textfile programmability, for this is what makes
      Remind a truly powerful calendaring system.
\end{enumerate}

Wyrd also requires only a fraction of the resources of most calendar programs
available today.


\section{Installation}
This section describes how to install Wyrd by compiling from source.  Volunteers have
pre-packaged Wyrd for several popular operating systems, so you may be able to save
yourself some time by installing from those packages.  Please check the 
%BEGIN LATEX
Wyrd website\footnote{http://www.eecs.umich.edu/\~{}pelzlpj/wyrd}
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~pelzlpj/wyrd/">Wyrd website</a> \end{rawhtml} 
for up-to-date package information.

Wyrd is designed to be portable to most Unix-like operating systems, including
GNU/Linux, *BSD, and Mac OS X.  Before installing Wyrd, your system must have the
following software installed:
\begin{itemize}
   \item
%BEGIN LATEX
      OCaml\footnote{http://caml.inria.fr} $\ge$ 3.08
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/">OCaml</a> >= 3.08 \end{rawhtml} 
   \item 
%BEGIN LATEX
      the ncurses library\footnote{http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html}
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html">ncurses library</a> \end{rawhtml} 
      (and development headers)
   \item 
%BEGIN LATEX
Remind \footnote{http://www.roaringpenguin.com/penguin/open\_source\_remind.php} $\ge$ 3.0.23
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/penguin/open_source_remind.php">Remind</a> >= 3.0.23 \end{rawhtml}
   \item standard Unix utilities such as \texttt{cat}, \texttt{sort}, \texttt{cal}, and
      \texttt{less} 
\end{itemize}
Wyrd may be compiled by executing the following at the root of the source tree:
\begin{verbatim}
./configure
make
\end{verbatim}
After compiling, become root and execute
\begin{verbatim}
make install
\end{verbatim}
to complete the installation process.

This section describes how to use Wyrd in its default configuration.  After
familiarizing yourself with the basic operations as outlined in this section,
you may wish to consult 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{advanced} 
%@% ELSE %@%
the \Cmd{wyrdrc}{5} manpage
%@% END-IF %@%
to see how Wyrd can be configured to better fit your needs.

\subsection{Overview}
Before attemping to use Wyrd, learn how to use Remind.  Wyrd makes no attempt
to hide the details of Remind programming from the user.

%@% IF LATEX %@%
You can launch Wyrd using the default reminder file by executing
\texttt{wyrd}.  If desired, a different reminder file may be selected by
executing \texttt{wyrd <filename>}.
%@% ELSE %@%
%@% END-IF %@%

At the top of the window is a short (incomplete) list of keybindings.

The left window displays a scrollable day schedule view, with reminders
highlighted in various colors.  If the \texttt{DURATION} specifier is used for a
reminder, the highlighted area is rendered with an appropriate size.
Overlapping reminders are rendered using one of four different indentation
levels so that all reminders are at least partially visible.

The upper right window displays a month calendar, with the color of each day
representing the number of reminders it contains.  The colors range across
shades of white to blue to magenta as the number of reminders increases.  The
selected date is highlighted in cyan.

The lower right window displays a list of the untimed reminders falling on
the selected date.

The bottom window displays the full text of the \texttt{MSG} for the reminder
or reminders that are currently selected.

\subsection{Navigation}
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}[t]{|l|l|}
%@% ELSE %@%
\begin{Table}{2}
%@% END-IF %@%
      \hline
      Action & Keypress \\
      \hline 
      scroll up and down the schedule & \texttt{<up>}, \texttt{<down>} or \texttt{k}, \texttt{j} \\
      jump back or forward by a day & \texttt{<pageup>}, \texttt{<pagedown>} or \texttt{4}, \texttt{6} or \texttt{<}, \texttt{>} or \texttt{H}, \texttt{L} \\
      jump back or forward by a week & \texttt{8}, \texttt{2} or \texttt{[}, \texttt{]} or \texttt{K}, \texttt{J} \\
      jump back or forward by a month & \texttt{\{}, \texttt{\}} \\
      jump to current date and time & \texttt{<home>} \\
      switch between schedule and untimed reminders window & \texttt{<left>}, \texttt{<right>} or \texttt{h}, \texttt{l} \\
      zoom in on the schedule & \texttt{z} \\
      scroll the description window up and down & \texttt{d}, \texttt{D} \\
      \hline
%@% IF LATEX %@%
   \end{tabular}
\end{center}
%@% ELSE %@%
\end{Table}
%@% END-IF %@%

Notice that if you have a numeric keypad, the \{\texttt{4, 6, 8, 2}\} keys will
let you move directionally in the month calendar view at the upper-right of the
screen.  Similarly, \{\texttt{H, J, K, L}\} will cause directional calendar
movement using the standard mapping from 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\texttt{vi(1)}.
%@% ELSE %@%
\Cmd{vi}{1}.
%@% END-IF %@%

\subsection{Editing Reminders}
Note: By default, Wyrd is configured to use the Vim editor for modifying your
reminder files.  To use a different editor, see
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{advanced}.
%@% ELSE %@%
the \Cmd{wyrdrc}{5} manpage.
%@% END-IF %@%

If you select a timeslot in the schedule view, then hit \texttt{'t'}, you will begin
creating a new timed reminder.  Wyrd will open up your reminder file in your
favorite editor and move the cursor to the end of the file, where a new
reminder template has been created.  The template has the selected date and
time filled in, so in many cases you will only need to fill in a \texttt{MSG} value.

Similarly, hitting \texttt{'u'} will begin creating an untimed reminder.
\texttt{'w'} will create a weekly timed reminder, and \texttt{'W'} will create a
weekly untimed reminder; \texttt{'m'} will create a monthly timed reminder, and
\texttt{'M'} will create a monthly untimed reminder.

\texttt{'T'} and \texttt{'U'} also create timed and untimed reminders
(respectively), but first will provide a selection dialog for you to choose
which reminder file you want to add this reminder to.  The set of reminder files
is determined by scanning the \texttt{INCLUDE} lines in your default reminder
file.

If you select a reminder (either timed or untimed) and hit \texttt{<return>}, you
will begin editing that reminder.  Wyrd will open up the appropriate reminders
file in your editor and move the cursor to the appropriate \texttt{REM} line.

If you select a timeslot that contains multiple overlapping reminders, Wyrd
will provide a dialog that allows you to select the desired reminder.

\subsection{Viewing Reminders}

Aside from viewing reminders as they fall in the schedule, you can press
\texttt{'r'} to view all reminders triggered on the selected date in a
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\texttt{less(1)}
%@% ELSE %@%
\Cmd{less}{1}
%@% END-IF %@%
window.  Similarly, \texttt{'R'} will view all reminders triggered
on or after the selected date (all non-expired reminders are triggered).

\subsection{Searching for Reminders}

Wyrd allows you to search for reminders with \texttt{MSG} values that match a search
string.  Press \texttt{'/'} to start entering a (case insensitive) regular
expression.  After the expression has been entered, press \texttt{<return>} and
Wyrd will locate the next reminder that matches the regexp.  Press \texttt{'n'} to
repeat the same search.  Entry of a search string may be cancelled with
\texttt{<esc>}.

The regular expression syntax is Emacs-compatible.

Note: Sorry, there is no "search backward" function.  The search function
requires the use of \texttt{"remind -n"}, which operates only forward in time.

\subsection{Other Commands}

You can exit Wyrd by pressing \texttt{'Q'}.  If the screen is corrupted for some
reason, hit \texttt{'Ctrl-L'} to refresh the display.

documentation is the user manual provided with Wyrd in PDF format.

%@% END-IF %@%
Wyrd reads a run-configuration textfile (generally \texttt{/etc/wyrdrc} or
\texttt{/usr/local/etc/wyrdrc}) to determine key bindings, color schemes,
and many other settings.  You can
create a personalized configuration file in \texttt{\$HOME/.wyrdrc}, and select
settings that match your usage patterns.  The recommended procedure is to ``include''
the \texttt{wyrdrc} file provided with Wyrd
%@% IF LATEX %@%
(see Section \ref{include}), 
%@% ELSE %@%
(see INCLUDING OTHER RCFILES),
%@% END-IF %@%
and add or remove settings as desired.

%@% IF LATEX %@%
\subsection{\texttt{wyrdrc} Syntax}
%@% ELSE %@%
\section{\texttt{wyrdrc} Syntax}
%@% END-IF %@%
You may notice that the \texttt{wyrdrc} syntax is similar to the syntax used in
the configuration file for the Mutt email client (muttrc).

Within the \texttt{wyrdrc} file, strings should be enclosed in double quotes (\texttt{"}).
A double quote character inside a string may be represented by 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\texttt{$\backslash$"} .
%@% ELSE %@%
\Bs " .
%@% END-IF %@%
The backslash character must be represented by doubling it 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
(\texttt{$\backslash\backslash$}).
%@% ELSE %@%
(\Bs\Bs).
%@% END-IF %@%

%@% IF LATEX %@%
\subsubsection{Including Other Rcfiles}
\label{include}
Syntax: \texttt{include \emph{filename\_string}} \\ \\
%@% ELSE %@%
\subsection{Including Other Rcfiles}
Syntax: include \emph{filename\_string} \\ \\
%@% END-IF %@%
This syntax can be used to include one run-configuration file within another.
This command could be used to load the default \texttt{wyrdrc} file (probably
found in \texttt{/etc/wyrdrc} or \texttt{/usr/local/etc/wyrdrc}) within your
personalized rcfile, 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\texttt{\~{}/.wyrdrc}.
%@% ELSE %@%
\Tilde /.wyrdrc .
%@% END-IF %@%
The filename string should be enclosed in quotes.

%@% IF LATEX %@%
\subsubsection{Setting Configuration Variables}
\label{setvar}
Syntax: \texttt{set \emph{variable}=\emph{value\_string}} \\ \\
%@% ELSE %@%
\subsection{Setting Configuration Variables}
Syntax: set \emph{variable}=\emph{value\_string} \\ \\
%@% END-IF %@%
A number of configuration variables can be set using this syntax; check
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{variables}
%@% ELSE %@%
the CONFIGURATION VARIABLES description
%@% END-IF %@%
to see a list.  The variables are unquoted, but the values should be quoted strings.

%@% IF LATEX %@%
\subsubsection{Creating Key Bindings}
\label{bindings}
Syntax: \texttt{bind \emph{key\_identifier operation}} \\ \\
%@% ELSE %@%
\subsection{Creating Key Bindings}
Syntax: bind \emph{key\_identifier operation} \\ \\
%@% END-IF %@%
This command will bind a keypress to execute a calendar operation.  
The various operations, which should not be enclosed in quotes,
may be found in 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{operationslist}. 
%@% ELSE %@%
the section on CALENDAR OPERATIONS.
%@% END-IF %@%
Key identifiers may be specified by strings that represent a single keypress,
for example \texttt{"m"} (quotes included).  The key may be prefixed with 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\texttt{"$\backslash\backslash$C"} or \texttt{"$\backslash\backslash$M"} 
%@% ELSE %@%
"\Bs\Bs C" or "\Bs\Bs M"
%@% END-IF %@%
to represent Control or Meta (Alt) modifiers, respectively; note that the
backslash must be doubled.  A number of special keys lack single-character
representations, so the following strings may be used to represent them:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{"<esc>"}
   \item \texttt{"<tab>"}
   \item \texttt{"<enter>"}
   \item \texttt{"<return>"}
   \item \texttt{"<insert>"}
   \item \texttt{"<home>"}
   \item \texttt{"<end>"}
   \item \texttt{"<pageup>"}
   \item \texttt{"<pagedown>"}
   \item \texttt{"<space>"}
   \item \texttt{"<left>"}
   \item \texttt{"<right>"}
   \item \texttt{"<up>"}
   \item \texttt{"<down>"}
   \item \texttt{"<f1>"} to \texttt{"<f12>"}
\end{itemize}
Due to differences between various terminal emulators, this key identifier syntax may
not be adequate to describe every keypress.  As a workaround, Wyrd will also accept key
identifiers in octal notation.  As an example, you could use 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\texttt{$\backslash$024} 
%@% ELSE %@%
\Bs 024
%@% END-IF %@%
(do \emph{not} enclose it in quotes) to represent Ctrl-T.

Multiple keys may be bound to the same operation, if desired.


%@% IF LATEX %@%
\subsubsection{Removing Key Bindings}
\label{unbindings}
Syntax: \texttt{unbind \emph{key\_identifier}} \\ \\
%@% ELSE %@%
\subsection{Removing Key Bindings}
Syntax: unbind \emph{key\_identifier} \\ \\
%@% END-IF %@%
This command will remove all bindings associated with the key identifier.  The
key identifiers should be defined using the syntax described in the previous
section.


%@% IF LATEX %@%
\subsubsection{Setting the Color Scheme}
\label{colors}
Syntax: \texttt{color \emph{object} \emph{foreground} \emph{background}} \\ \\
%@% ELSE %@%
\subsection{Setting the Color Scheme}
Syntax: color \emph{object} \emph{foreground} \emph{background} \\ \\
%@% END-IF %@%
This command will apply the specified foreground and background colors to the
appropriate object.  A list of colorable objects is provided in
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{colorable objects}.
%@% ELSE %@%
the section on COLORABLE OBJECTS.
%@% END-IF %@%
Wyrd will recognize the following color keywords: \texttt{black, red, green, yellow,
blue, magenta, cyan, white}.

      filename to edit and a line number to navigate to within that file.
   \item \texttt{edit\_new\_command} \\
      Controls the command used to edit a new reminder.  The special character
      \texttt{'\%f'} will be substituted with a filename to edit.  Ideally, this
      command should move the cursor to the last line of the file, where the new
      reminder template is created.
   \item \texttt{timed\_template} \\
      Controls the format of the \texttt{REM} line created when editing a new
      timed reminder.  The following character substitutions will be made:
      \texttt{'\%M'} - month name, \texttt{'\%d'} - day of the month,
      \texttt{'\%y'} - year, \texttt{'\%h'} - hour, \texttt{'\%m'} - minute,
      \texttt{'\%w'} - weekday name.
   \item \texttt{untimed\_template} \\

      in bold.
   \item \texttt{busy\_level4} \\
      Same as above, using the \texttt{calendar\_level3} color scheme.  Any day
      with more reminders than this will be rendered using the
      \texttt{calendar\_level3} color scheme rendered in bold.
   \item \texttt{week\_starts\_monday} \\
      A boolean value (\texttt{"true"} or \texttt{"false"}) that determines the
      first day of the week.
   \item \texttt{schedule\_12\_hour} \\
      A boolean value that determines whether the timed reminders window is
      drawn using 12- or 24-hour time.
   \item \texttt{selection\_12\_hour} \\
      A boolean value that determines whether the selection information is drawn
      with 12- or 24-hour time.
