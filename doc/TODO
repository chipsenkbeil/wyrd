Wyrd To-Do list
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Consider incremental searching.

* Consider an Orpie-like abbreviation syntax for inputting commands.

* Consider a more compact "maximum zoom" view that eliminates spaces between
  reminders--similar to Remind's formatted calendar, but formatted vertically
  like Wyrd's primary display.

* When LINES is sufficiently large, consider adding a bit more month context in
  the calendar window at the upper right.

* If advance warning is enabled, improve search performance by caching reminders 
  with advance warning suppressed.
