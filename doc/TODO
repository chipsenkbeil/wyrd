Wyrd To-Do list
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add commands to jump to the next/previous reminder in time.

* Add a TAG handler that hides reminders from counting towards the
  calendar coloration.  (Are there any other TAG options that could
  be useful?).

* Consider incremental searching.

* Think about centering the timed reminder view vertically so that the
  selected timeslot is in the middle.  (Make it optional.)

* Consider an Orpie-like abbreviation syntax for inputting commands.

* When LINES is sufficiently large, consider adding a bit more month context in
  the calendar window at the upper right.
