Wyrd To-Do list
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix the /tmp/wyrd-tmp file so it is unique per-user (/tmp/wyrd-temp.username)

* Review new code for highlighting current timeslot.  In particular, make sure
  that highlight gets properly erased and redrawn when the time passes from
  one timeslot to another.

* Consider incremental searching.

* Consider an Orpie-like abbreviation syntax for inputting commands.

* Consider a more compact "maximum zoom" view that eliminates spaces between
  reminders--similar to Remind's formatted calendar, but formatted vertically
  like Wyrd's primary display.

* When LINES is sufficiently large, consider adding a bit more month context in
  the calendar window at the upper right.
