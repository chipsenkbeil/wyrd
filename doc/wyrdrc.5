.SH NAME

wyrdrc is the configuration textfile for the \fIwyrd\fP(1)
console calendar application. 
.PP
.SH INTRODUCTION

CAUTION: while this manpage should be suitable as a quick reference, it may 
be subject to miscellaneous shortcomings in typesetting. The definitive 
documentation is the user manual provided with Wyrd in PDF format. 
.PP
Wyrd reads a run\-configuration textfile (generally /etc/wyrdrc or 
/usr/local/etc/wyrdrc) to determine key bindings, color schemes, 
and many other settings. You can 
create a personalized configuration file in $HOME/.wyrdrc, and select 
settings that match your usage patterns. The recommended procedure is to ``include\&'' 
the wyrdrc file provided with Wyrd 
(see INCLUDING OTHER RCFILES), 
and add or remove settings as desired. 
.PP
.SH WYRDRC SYNTAX

You may notice that the wyrdrc syntax is similar to the syntax used in 
the configuration file for the Mutt email client (muttrc). 
.PP
Within the wyrdrc file, strings should be enclosed in double quotes ("). 
A double quote character inside a string may be represented by 
\\" \&. 
The backslash character must be represented by doubling it 
(\\\\).
.PP
.SS INCLUDING OTHER RCFILES
Syntax: include \fIfilename_string\fP
.br 
.br 
This syntax can be used to include one run\-configuration file within another. 
This command could be used to load the default wyrdrc file (probably 
found in /etc/wyrdrc or /usr/local/etc/wyrdrc) within your 
personalized rcfile, 
~/.wyrdrc \&. 
The filename string should be enclosed in quotes. 
.PP
.SS SETTING CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
Syntax: set \fIvariable\fP=\fIvalue_string\fP
.br 
.br 
A number of configuration variables can be set using this syntax; check 
the CONFIGURATION VARIABLES description 
to see a list. The variables are unquoted, but the values should be quoted strings. 
.PP
.SS CREATING KEY BINDINGS
Syntax: bind \fIkey_identifier operation\fP
.br 
.br 
This command will bind a keypress to execute a calendar operation. 
The various operations, which should not be enclosed in quotes, 
may be found in 
the section on CALENDAR OPERATIONS. 
Key identifiers may be specified by strings that represent a single keypress, 
for example "m" (quotes included). The key may be prefixed with 
"\\\\C" or "\\\\M" 
to represent Control or Meta (Alt) modifiers, respectively; note that the 
backslash must be doubled. A number of special keys lack single\-character 
representations, so the following strings may be used to represent them: 
.TP
.B *
"<esc>" 
.TP
.B *
"<tab>" 
.TP
.B *
"<enter>" 
.TP
.B *
"<return>" 
.TP
.B *
"<insert>" 
.TP
.B *
"<home>" 
.TP
.B *
"<end>" 
.TP
.B *
"<pageup>" 
.TP
.B *
"<pagedown>" 
.TP
.B *
"<space>" 
.TP
.B *
"<left>" 
.TP
.B *
"<right>" 
.TP
.B *
"<up>" 
.TP
.B *
"<down>" 
.TP
.B *
"<f1>" to "<f12>" 
.PP
Due to differences between various terminal emulators, this key identifier syntax may 
not be adequate to describe every keypress. As a workaround, Wyrd will also accept key 
identifiers in octal notation. As an example, you could use 
\\024 
(do \fInot\fP
enclose it in quotes) to represent Ctrl\-T. 
.PP
Multiple keys may be bound to the same operation, if desired. 
.PP
.SS REMOVING KEY BINDINGS
Syntax: unbind \fIkey_identifier\fP
.br 
.br 
This command will remove all bindings associated with the key identifier. The 
key identifiers should be defined using the syntax described in the previous 
section. 
.PP
.SS SETTING THE COLOR SCHEME
Syntax: color \fIobject\fP
\fIforeground\fP
\fIbackground\fP
.br 
.br 
This command will apply the specified foreground and background colors to the 
appropriate object. A list of colorable objects is provided in 
the section on COLORABLE OBJECTS. 
Wyrd will recognize the following color keywords: black, red, green, yellow, 
blue, magenta, cyan, white, default. The default keyword allows you to 
choose the default foreground or background colors. If you use 
default for your background color, this will access the transparent 
background on terminal emulators which support it. 
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION VARIABLES

The following configuration variables may be set as described in the SETTING 
CONFIGURATION VARIABLES section. 
.TP
.B *
remind_command 
.br 
Determines the command used to execute Remind. 
.TP
.B *
reminders_file 
.br 
Controls which Remind file (or Remind directory) Wyrd will operate on. The default is 
~/.reminders \&. 
.TP
.B *
edit_old_command 
.br 
Controls the command used to edit a pre\-existing reminder. The special 
strings \&'%file%\&' and \&'%line%\&' will be replaced with a 
filename to edit and a line number to navigate to within that file. 
.TP
.B *
edit_new_command 
.br 
Controls the command used to edit a new reminder. The special character 
\&'%file%\&' will be replaced with a filename to edit. Ideally, this 
command should move the cursor to the last line of the file, where the new 
reminder template is created. 
.TP
.B *
edit_any_command 
.br 
Controls the command used for editing a reminder file without selecting 
any particular reminder. The special character \&'%file%\&' will be 
replaced with a filename to edit. 
.TP
.B *
timed_template 
.br 
Controls the format of the REM line created when editing a new 
timed reminder. The following string substitutions will be made: 
\&'%monname%\&' \- month name, \&'%mon%\&' \- month number, 
\&'%mday%\&' \- day of the month, \&'%year%\&' \- year, 
\&'%hour%\&' \- hour, \&'%min%\&' \- minute, 
\&'%wdayname%\&' \- weekday name, \&'%wday%\&' \- weekday number. 
.TP
.B *
untimed_template 
.br 
Controls the format of the REM line created when editing a new 
untimed reminder. The substitution syntax is the same as for 
timed_template. 
.TP
.B *
template\fIN\fP 
.br
Controls the format of a generic user\-defined REM line template; 
\fIN\fP
may range from 0 to 9. The substitution syntax is the same as 
for timed_template. 
.TP
.B *
busy_algorithm 
.br 
An integer value specifying which algorithm to use for measuring how 
busy the user is on a particular day. If busy_algorithm="1", 
then Wyrd will simply count the total number of reminders triggered on 
that day. If busy_algorithm="2", then Wyrd will count the 
number of hours of reminders that fall on that day. (Untimed reminders 
are assumed to occupy untimed_duration minutes.) 
.TP
.B *
untimed_duration 
.br 
An integer value that specifies the assumed duration of an untimed 
reminder, in minutes. This is used only when computing the busy level 
with busy_algorithm="2". 
.TP
.B *
busy_level1 
.br 
An integer value specifying the maximum number of reminders in a day 
(with busy_algorithm="1") or maximum hours of reminders in 
a day (with busy_algorithm="2") which will be 
colored using the color scheme for calendar_level1. 
.TP
.B *
busy_level2 
.br 
Same as above, using the calendar_level2 color scheme. 
.TP
.B *
busy_level3 
.br 
Same as above, using the calendar_level2 color scheme rendered 
in bold. 
.TP
.B *
busy_level4 
.br 
Same as above, using the calendar_level3 color scheme. Any day 
with more reminders than this will be rendered using the 
calendar_level3 color scheme rendered in bold. 
.TP
.B *
week_starts_monday 
.br 
A boolean value ("true" or "false") that determines the 
first day of the week. 
.TP
.B *
schedule_12_hour 
.br 
A boolean value that determines whether the timed reminders window is 
drawn using 12\- or 24\-hour time. 
.TP
.B *
selection_12_hour 
.br 
A boolean value that determines whether the selection information is drawn 
with 12\- or 24\-hour time. 
.TP
.B *
status_12_hour 
.br 
A boolean value that determines whether the current time is drawn using a 
12\- or 24\-hour clock. 
.TP
.B *
description_12_hour 
.br 
A boolean value that determines whether reminder start and end times are 
drawn using 12\- or 24\-hour time in the description window. This value 
also controls the format of timestamps in the formatted calendars 
produced by view_week and view_month. 
.TP
.B *
center_cursor 
.br 
A boolean value that determines how the screen and cursor move during 
scrolling operations. When set to "true", the cursor is fixed 
in the center of the timed reminders window, and the schedule scrolls around 
it. When set to "false" (the default), the cursor will move up 
and down the schedule during scrolling operations. 
.TP
.B *
goto_big_endian 
.br 
A boolean value that determines how the the goto operation will 
parse dates. When set to "true", date specifiers should be in 
ISO 8601 (YYYYMMDD) format. When set to "false", date specifiers 
should be in European style DDMMYYYY format. 
.TP
.B *
quick_date_US 
.br 
A boolean value that determines how the quick_add operation 
will parse numeric dates with slashes, e.g. 6/1 (or 6/1/2006). When set 
to "true", the first number is a month and the second is the day 
of the month (June 1). When set to "false", these meanings of 
these two fields are switched (January 6). 
.TP
.B *
number_weeks 
.br 
A boolean value that determines whether or not weeks should be numbered 
within the month calendar window. Weeks are numbered according to the ISO 
8601 standard. The ISO standard week begins on Monday, so to avoid 
confusion it is recommended that week_starts_monday be set to 
"true" when week numbering is enabled. 
.TP
.B *
home_sticky 
.br 
A boolean value that determines whether or not the cursor should 
"stick" to the "home" position. When this option is set to 
"true", then after pressing the <home> key the 
cursor will automatically follow the current date and time. The 
effect is cancelled by pressing any of the navigation keys. 
.TP
.B *
untimed_window_width 
.br 
An integer value that determines the target width of the month\-calendar 
window and the untimed reminders window. The allowable range is 
34 to ($COLUMNS \- 40) characters, and Wyrd will silently 
disregard any setting outside this range. 
.TP
.B *
advance_warning 
.br 
A boolean value that determines whether or not Wyrd should display 
advance warning of reminders. When set to "true", Wyrd 
will invoke Remind in a mode that generates advance warning of reminders 
as specified in the reminder file. 
.TP
.B *
untimed_bold 
.br 
A boolean value that determines whether or not Wyrd should render 
untimed reminders using a bold font. 
.PP
For maximum usefulness, busy_level1 < busy_level2 < 
busy_level3 < busy_level4. 
.PP
