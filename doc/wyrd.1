.SH QUICK START

CAUTION: while this manpage should be suitable as a quick reference, it may 
be subject to miscellaneous shortcomings in typesetting. The definitive 
documentation is the user manual provided with Wyrd in PDF or HTML format. 
.PP
This section describes how to use Wyrd in its default configuration. After 
familiarizing yourself with the basic operations as outlined in this section, 
you may wish to consult 
the \fIwyrdrc\fP(5)
manpage 
to see how Wyrd can be configured to better fit your needs. 
.PP
.SS OVERVIEW
Before attempting to use Wyrd, learn how to use Remind. Wyrd makes no attempt 
to hide the details of Remind programming from the user. 
.PP
At the top of the window is a short (incomplete) list of keybindings. 
.PP
The left window displays a scrollable timetable view, with reminders 
highlighted in various colors. If the DURATION specifier is used for a 
reminder, the highlighted area is rendered with an appropriate size. 
Overlapping reminders are rendered using one of four different indentation 
levels so that all reminders are at least partially visible. If the current 
time is visible in this window, it is highlighted in red. 
.PP
The upper right window displays a month calendar, with the color of each day 
representing the number of reminders it contains. The colors range across 
shades of white to blue to magenta as the number of reminders increases. The 
selected date is highlighted in cyan; if the current date is visible, it 
is highlighted in red. 
.PP
The lower right window displays a list of the untimed reminders falling on 
the selected date. 
.PP
The bottom window displays the full text of the MSG for the reminder 
or reminders that are currently selected. 
.PP
.SS NAVIGATION

.PP
Notice that if you have a numeric keypad, the {4, 6, 8, 2} keys will 
let you move directionally in the month calendar view at the upper\-right of the 
screen. Similarly, {H, J, K, L} will cause directional calendar 
movement using the standard mapping from 
\fIvi\fP(1)\&.
.PP
In addition to the hotkeys provided above, Wyrd lets you jump immediately to a 
desired date by pressing \&'g\&', entering in a date specifier, and 
then pressing <return>. Any of the following date specifiers may be used: 
.TP
.B *
8 digits representing year, month, and day: YYYYMMDD 
.TP
.B *
4 digits representing month and day (of current year): MMDD 
.TP
.B *
2 digits representing day (of current month and year): DD 
.PP
(The date specifier format may be changed to DDMMYYYY; consult 
the section on CONFIGURATION VARIABLES. 
) 
.PP
.SS EDITING REMINDERS
Note: By default, Wyrd is configured to modify your reminder files using the 
text editor specified by the $EDITOR environment variable. (This 
configuration has been tested successfully with a number of common settings for 
$EDITOR, including \&'vim\&', \&'emacs\&', and 
\&'nano\&'\&.) If you wish to use a different editor, see 
the \fIwyrdrc\fP(5)
manpage. 
.PP
If you select a timeslot in the schedule view, then hit \&'t\&', you will begin 
creating a new timed reminder. Wyrd will open up your reminder file in your 
favorite editor and move the cursor to the end of the file, where a new 
reminder template has been created. The template has the selected date and 
time filled in, so in many cases you will only need to fill in a MSG value. 
.PP
Similarly, hitting \&'u\&' will begin creating an untimed reminder. 
\&'w\&' will create a weekly timed reminder, and \&'W\&' will create a 
weekly untimed reminder; \&'m\&' will create a monthly timed reminder, and 
\&'M\&' will create a monthly untimed reminder. 
.PP
\&'T\&' and \&'U\&' also create timed and untimed reminders 
(respectively), but first will provide a selection dialog for you to choose 
which reminder file you want to add this reminder to. The set of reminder files 
is determined by scanning the INCLUDE lines in your default reminder 
file. (If you use a reminder directory, then all *.rem files in that directory 
will be available along with all INCLUDEd files.) 
.PP
If you select a reminder (either timed or untimed) and hit <return>, you 
will begin editing that reminder. Wyrd will open up the appropriate reminders 
file in your editor and move the cursor to the corresponding REM line. 
.PP
If you select a timeslot that contains multiple overlapping reminders, Wyrd 
will provide a dialog that allows you to select the desired reminder. 
.PP
If you hit <enter> on a blank timeslot, Wyrd will begin creating a new 
timed or untimed reminder (depending on whether the timed or the untimed window 
is selected). 
.PP
Finally, pressing \&'e\&' will open the reminder file in your editor without 
attempting to select any particular reminder. 
.PP
.SS QUICK REMINDERS
Wyrd offers an additional mode for entering simple reminders quickly. Press 
\&'q\&', and you will be prompted for an event description. Simply enter 
a description for the event using natural language, then press 
<return>. Examples: 
.TP
.B *
meeting with Bob tomorrow at 11 
.TP
.B *
drop off package at 3pm 
.TP
.B *
wednesday 10am\-11:30 go grocery shopping 
.TP
.B *
Board game night 20:15 next Fri 
.TP
.B *
7/4 independence day 
.TP
.B *
7/4/2007 independence day (next year) 
.TP
.B *
independence day (next year) on 2007\-07\-04 
.PP
If your event description can be understood, Wyrd will immediately create the 
reminder and scroll the display to its location. 
.PP
Currently the quick reminder mode tends to favor USA English conventions, as 
generalizing the natural language parser would require some work. 
.PP
Wyrd also allows you to use the "quick reminder" syntax to create new reminders 
from the command line, using the \-a or \-\-add options. For 
example, 
.Vb
wyrd \-\-add "dinner with neighbors tomorrow at 7pm"
.Ve
would create a new reminder for tomorrow evening. When used in this mode, 
Wyrd exits silently with error code 0 if the reminder was successfully created. 
If the reminder could not be created (e.g. if the reminder syntax could not be 
parsed), Wyrd prints an error message and exits with a nonzero error code. 
.PP
.SS CUTTING AND PASTING REMINDERS
Reminders can be easily duplicated or rescheduled through the use of Wyrd\&'s 
cutting and pasting features. 
.PP
Selecting a reminder and pressing \&'X\&' will cut that reminder: the 
corresponding REM line is deleted from your reminders file, and the 
reminder is copied to Wyrd\&'s clipboard. To copy a reminder without deleting it, 
use \&'y\&' instead. 
.PP
To paste a reminder from the clipboard back into your schedule, just move the 
cursor to the desired date/time and press \&'p\&'\&. Wyrd will append a 
new REM line to the end of your reminders file, and open the file with 
your editor. The REM line will be configured to trigger on the 
selected date. If the copied reminder was timed, then the pasted reminder will 
be set to trigger at the selected time using the original DURATION 
setting. (Additional Remind settings such as delta and tdelta 
are not preserved by copy\-and\-paste.) 
.PP
If you wish to paste a reminder into a non\-default reminders file, use 
\&'P\&'\&. This will spawn a selection dialog where you can choose the 
file that will hold the new reminder. 
.PP
WARNING: Cutting a reminder will delete only the single REM command 
responsible for triggering it. If you are using more complicated Remind 
scripting techniques to generate a particular reminder, then the cut 
operation may not do what you want. 
.PP
.SS VIEWING REMINDERS
.PP
Aside from viewing reminders as they fall in the schedule, you can press 
\&'r\&' to view all reminders triggered on the selected date in a 
\fIless\fP(1)
window. Similarly, \&'R\&' will view all reminders triggered 
on or after the selected date (all non\-expired reminders are triggered). 
.PP
If you want to get a more global view of your schedule, Wyrd will also 
let you view Remind\&'s formatted calendar output in a 
\fIless\fP(1)
window. Pressing \&'c\&' will view a one\-week calendar that contains 
the selected date, while pressing \&'C\&' will view a one\-month calendar 
containing the selected date. 
.PP
.SS SEARCHING FOR REMINDERS
.PP
Wyrd allows you to search for reminders with MSG values that match a search 
string. Press \&'/\&' to start entering a (case insensitive) regular 
expression. After the expression has been entered, press <return> and 
Wyrd will locate the next reminder that matches the regexp. Press \&'n\&' to 
repeat the same search. Entry of a search string may be cancelled with 
<esc>. 
.PP
The regular expression syntax is Emacs\-compatible. 
.PP
Note: Sorry, there is no "search backward" function. The search function 
requires the use of "remind \-n", which operates only forward in time. 
For the same reason, there is a command to jump forward to the next reminder, 
but no command to jump backward to the previous reminder. 
.PP
.SS OTHER COMMANDS
.PP
A list of all keybindings may be viewed by pressing \&'?\&'\&. You can exit 
Wyrd by pressing \&'Q\&'\&. If the screen is corrupted for some reason, hit 
\&'Ctrl\-L\&' to refresh the display. 
.PP
.SS ALARM STRATEGIES
You may wish to generate some sort of alarm when a reminder is triggered. 
Wyrd does not offer any special alarm functionality, because Remind can handle 
the job already. Check the Remind manpage and consider how the \-k 
option could be used to generate alarms with the aid of external programs. For 
example, the following command will generate a popup window using 
gxmessage(1) whenever a timed reminder is triggered: 
.Vb
remind \-z \-k'gxmessage \-title "reminder"  &' ~/.reminders &
.Ve
(A sensible way to start this alarm command is to place it in 
 {.xinitrc} so that it launches when the X server is started.) 
If you want some advance warning (say, 15 minutes), you can cause Remind to 
trigger early by setting a tdelta in the AT clause: 
.Vb
   REM Nov 27 2005 AT 14:30 +15 MSG Do something
.Ve
.PP
Alternatively, if you want to generate alarms only for specific reminders, 
consider using Remind\&'s RUN command. This process could be easily 
automated by using the template\fIN\fP
configuration variables 
described in 
the \fIwyrdrc\fP(5)
manpage. 
.PP
.SS MISCELLANEOUS
.PP
Remind\&'s TAG specifier may be used to cause Wyrd to give special 
treatment to certain reminders. If a reminder line includes the clause 
"TAG noweight", then Wyrd will not give that reminder any weight when 
determining the ``busy level\&'' colorations applied to the month calendar. If a 
reminder line includes the clause "TAG nodisplay", then Wyrd will 
neither display that reminder nor give it any weight when determining the month 
calendar colorations. The tag parameters are case insensitive. 
.PP
WARNING: These tag parameters are not guaranteed to interact well with other 
Remind front\-ends such as tkremind. 
.PP
.SH USAGE TIPS

.TP
.B *
Wyrd fills in sensible defaults for the fields of a REM statement, but 
you will inevitably need to make some small edits to achieve the behavior 
you want. If you use Vim, you can make your life easier by installing the 
Vim\-Latex Suite and then modifying your 
~/.wyrdrc
to use REM templates like this: 
.PP
set timed_template="REM %monname% %mday% %year% <++>AT %hour%:%min%<++> DURATION 1:00<++> MSG %\\"<++>%\\" %b" 
.br 
set untimed_template="REM %monname% %mday% %year% <++>MSG %\\"<++>%\\" %b" 
.PP
With this change, hitting Ctrl\-J inside Vim (in insert mode) will cause your 
cursor to jump directly to the <++> markers, enabling you to quickly add any 
desired Remind delta and message parameters.
