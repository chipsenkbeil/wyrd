Remic overview

User can scroll up and down left panel with up/down or j/k.  If an appointment
block gets highlighted, the complete appointment MSG value is displayed
in the bottom couple of lines of the screen (it is possible that the MSG is
truncated in the window above).  User can hit left/right or h/l to jump between
left panel and lower-right panel.  Lower-right panel shows untimed events
for the day.  In this window, scrolling up and down will switch between
the full-day events.

User may hit <t> to make a new timed reminder or <u> for an untimed
reminder.  This opens up ~/.reminders in an editor, and adds a reminder stub
at the end of the file, e.g.

   REM Mar 28 2005 AT 11:00 DURATION 1:00 MSG        (for timed)
   REM Mar 28 2005 MSG                               (for untimed)

User may hit <enter> when highlighting a reminder.  This opens up ~/.reminders
in an editor, and executes a search function that brings the cursor to the first
line with matching MSG.

The timed reminders are highlighted in a block with size given by the
DURATION value reported by 'remind -p'.

Calendar window operates as in pylot.  As days of the month are navigated,
the full-day appointments get updated at the same time.
