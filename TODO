Wyrd To-Do list
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Figure out some way to handle overlapping timed reminders.

* Implement a memoization mechanism to speed up drawing of timed 
  reminders window when scrolling.

* Add additional user-defined REMline templates, which can be
  activated via the 'bind' syntax.

* Add additional "new reminder" commands that provide a dialog for selecting
  which reminder file to use (possibly scanning INCLUDE lines to get this
  info).

* When LINES is sufficiently large, consider adding a bit more month context in
  the calendar window at the upper right.
