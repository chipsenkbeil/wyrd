Wyrd To-Do list
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Handle terminal resizes.

* Figure out some way to handle overlapping timed reminders.

* Implement a memoization mechanism to speed up drawing of timed 
  reminders window when scrolling.

* Add additional user-defined REMline templates, which can be
  activated via the 'bind' syntax.

* Make color scheme configurable.

* Make 12/24 hour time configurable.

* Accept reminders file as a command line parameter.

* Add additional "new reminder" commands that provide a dialog for selecting
  which reminder file to use (possibly scanning INCLUDE lines to get this
  info).

* Add commands that trigger 'rem -q -g <date> | less' and 
  'rem -q -t -g <date> | less' or something similar.

* When LINES is sufficiently large, consider adding a bit more month context in
  the calendar window at the upper right.
