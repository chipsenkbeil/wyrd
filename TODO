Wyrd To-Do list
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Figure out some way to handle overlapping timed reminders.

* Add additional "new reminder" commands that provide a dialog for selecting
  which reminder file to use (possibly scanning INCLUDE lines to get this
  info).

* When LINES is sufficiently large, consider adding a bit more month context in
  the calendar window at the upper right.
